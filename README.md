##Idea
Create a service that will take various parameters and return an screenshot from a specified URL. 

Parameters could include a selector, coodinates, viewport, user-agent, etc. Use cases include instagram/twitter bots, 'dynamic' newsletter content, testing, advertising, etc.

##Dependencies
[express](http://expressjs.com/) for the main web-application and [pageres](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres) for the screen shoting service.

[configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) is based on environmental variables but is very versatile

##Why node?
Mainly [pageres](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres) but I also like the idea that you could request a screenshot and node could automatically start processing a new image but reply to the client with a cached copy. That way popular images stay more fresh than less popular. 

##TL;DR;
Clone this repo
```
cd screen-canon
```
```
npm install
```
```
export NODE_ENV=development;
node app.js
```
Go and grab a [screenshot of buzzfeed splash](http://localhost:3000/?url=buzzfeed.com&selector=.splash__container)
